COVID-19 has become a great threat to humanity as many are infected with the virus. COVID-19 affects many people and the death rate is increasing rapidly. As the number of death increases around the world, it is of concern to many scientists and 
authorities. The main problem of COVID-19 is that we cannot see the symptoms such as cold, cough, although the person suffers from COVID-19 and most of the people think that cold, cough and fever are normal and neglect them which leads to a serious illness. Therefore, the government must educate people to take the disease seriously, and the government must strictly block the virus containment areas so that avoiding 
body contact and wearing a mask helps reduce cases. .

**ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED :**
Four algorithms have been implemented in this base paper, and they are: 
1. Linear regression(LR) 
2. Support vector regression(SVR) 
3. LASSO regression 
4. Exponential Smoothing(ES)

3 types of dataset used in this project Confirmed cases, death cases and recovered cases. These are time series dataset which help us to predict the confirmed cases , death cases and recovered cases in future 

**Performance**
